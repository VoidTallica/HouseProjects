## 1- Moca Ethernet Setup

Since i didn't have ethernet access to my bedroom, and Powerlines SUCK, i decided to study and implement a MOCA setup in my house, and let me tell ya, IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!
I was a little bit skeptical about this technology working on my house, since i have ancient coax instalattion (20 years old cables and splitters).

Don't know why this is not used or advirtised as much in Europe, since most houses have coax cables, but i'm glad i found this solution.

Bought: 2X goCoax Adaptador Moca 2.5 (Amazon)
        1X PoE Filtter (Amazon)
        Only 2 spliters needed "Televes repartidor easyf" 4x and 3x (Amazon) for main distribution and receiver

I have a 500/100 MB Network, so having full speed with all this partitions is awesome.

Even tho this devices are stupid expensive in Europe, i still think it was a good investement. Been using them since June and no complaints whatsoever.
